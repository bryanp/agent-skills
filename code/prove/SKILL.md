name: prove
description: Prove that your work is satisfactory
---

Generate proof that the work you implemented satisfies the original request. 

# Rule: Content

The proof should be as concise as possible. It should thoroughly demonstate
to a human how the implementation works and how they can verify it works. 
Provide steps they can take to run and verify the implementation themselves 
(cli commands, clicking through in a web browser, etc).

Approach this like you would a presentation to your boss.

# Rule: Verify Proof

Iterate between implementation and proof until you're sure the implementation
is correct. Use the oracle to compare the implementation to the plan and proof
so that the conclusion is unbiased. Err on the side of correctness!
