description: Audit the codebase for consistency and style
---

Look through the codebase and compare the code against the rules, philosophy, and
style described in `AGENTS.md` and other documentation. Employ the oracle as needed
for this work. Ignore the implementation itself (as well as implementation plans).
This is purely an exercise in fixing style/philosophy problems.

# Rule: Commit Work

Use the `git-commit` skill to commit your work after the audit is complete.
